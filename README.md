# Geodesic Growth of Numbered Graph Products

The files here are a supplement to our paper _Geodesic growth of numbered graph products_ ([arXiv:2208.13095](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13095)).

- `racg.pdf` contains detailed calculations using Theorem 6.4 from the above paper. In particular, it derives the formula for the geodesic growth of a right-angled Coxeter group (RACG) associated to a link-regular graph with maximum clique size $d = 3$ and $d = 4$.
- `racg.sage` is a Sage program that calculates the formula for the geodesic growth of a RACG associated to a link-regular graph with an arbitrary maximum clique size $d$. The file can be run with Sage (or by pasting its contents into Sage), and the parameter $d$ can be set in the first line.
